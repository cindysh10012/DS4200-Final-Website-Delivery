    <h1>LinkedIn: A Glimpse Into The Job Market</h1>
    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the dynamic landscape of talent acquisition, LinkedIn stands as a pivotal platform where thousands of companies and individuals converge daily in pursuit of professional connections and job opportunities. In recent times, many of us - especially those who are entering the workforce for the first time - have faced certain difficulties with being hired and in our career progression. Disparities with economists stating that the job market is ‘hot’, while those who are actually applying feel differently has driven us to try and gather some of our own findings. Given its prevalence at the forefront of career development, we felt that exploring data on LinkedIn could help to provide insight not only to the topic as a whole, but on a professional level as well. Analyzing this data will give us an idea of what the job market really looks like and how one might be able to navigate it more effectively. </p>

    <h2>Introduction to the data</h2>
    <p>For our project, we will be examining the LinkedIn Job Postings - 2023 dataset from Kaggle. This dataset, featuring a comprehensive record of over 33,000 job postings gathered over two distinct days months apart, provides a rich repository of information that we can work with. Each individual job posting comprises twenty-seven essential attributes, ranging from job titles and descriptions to salaries, locations, and work types. 

        The sheer magnitude of data points opens up a vast realm of possibilities for exploration, including the analysis of highest-salary titles, companies, and locations. The dataset allows for predictive modeling of salaries and benefits by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, along with examining variations in industries and companies through internship offerings and benefits. Furthermore, the dataset's potential extends to investigating time-based trends, such as company growth, the prevalence of remote jobs, and the evolving demand for specific job titles. 
        
        With this, we hope to gain the opportunity to delve deeper and provide valuable insight into the ever-changing dynamics of the job market.
