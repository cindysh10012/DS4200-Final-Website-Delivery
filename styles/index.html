    <h2>The most common words or phrases used in job titles</h2>
    <p>The word cloud visualization is generated by extracting job titles from a DataFrame and representing them in a graphical format. The size of each word in the cloud corresponds to its frequency or significance relative to other words in the dataset. Analysis of the word cloud reveals that roles related to ownership, operation, and directorship constitute a substantial portion of the job market, underscoring the importance of leadership skill development. Additionally, sales, programming, and engineering skills emerge as commonly sought-after attributes. It's important to note that the choice of colors in the visualization is purely for aesthetic appeal and does not convey any specific meaning related to the textual content.</p>

    <h2>Heatmap of Top Skill Names by Experience Level</h2>
    <p>The heatmap visualizes the top 10 most sought-after skills, ranked by the number of job postings, with the X-axis representing skill names and the Y-axis representing the experience levels. The intensity of red shading indicates the frequency of job postings on LinkedIn. The graph reveals that entry-level and mid-senior roles dominate the job market across skill categories. Particularly, Information Technology and engineering stand out as high-demand sectors for mid-senior level positions. However, the scarcity of internship opportunities amidst the job postings presents a concerning trend for college students. This pattern underscores a systemic issue where companies prioritize hiring individuals with existing skills, neglecting investment in internship programs. This dearth of internships poses a significant challenge for college students aiming to gain practical experience and advance their careers.</p>
