    <h2>Introduction to the data</h2>

        </p>

    <h2>The most common words or phrases used in job titles</h2>
    <p>The word cloud visualization is generated by extracting job titles from a DataFrame and representing them in a graphical format. The size of each word in the cloud corresponds to its frequency or significance relative to other words in the dataset. Analysis of the word cloud reveals that roles related to ownership, operation, and directorship constitute a substantial portion of the job market, underscoring the importance of leadership skill development. Additionally, sales, programming, and engineering skills emerge as commonly sought-after attributes. It's important to note that the choice of colors in the visualization is purely for aesthetic appeal and does not convey any specific meaning related to the textual content.</p>

    <h2>Median Salaries Chloropleth Map</h2>
    <p>Interactive Chloropleth Map that visualizes all 50 statesâ€™ median and average salaries using a color scale. You can toggle one of the layers or both using the legend. There is a ToolTip that shows the state name as well as the median and average salaries depending on which one you selected. We can see that the highest average salaries tend to be in some of the more populous states such as California, Texas, and New York, as well as the Midwest. The median salaries show a larger salary spread, suggesting that some states have certain jobs or industries that are inflating or deflating the average. One example of this is Wisconsin, which appears to have a lower average salary but a higher median, suggesting that there are some jobs that are bringing the average down. To add on, the interactive map provides valuable insights into regional salary distributions, highlighting disparities in income across states and shedding light on factors influencing average and median earnings.</p>

    <h2>Top 3 Industries Sankey Diagram</h2>
    <p>Interactive Sankey Diagram created using D3, along with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The Javascript is where most of the code is, where the CSS was used to increase the size of the page to display more information. The HTML then implemented the JS and CSS. Keywords were found in each job to separate the industries into three categories: Business (Orange), Healthcare (Green) and Technology (Cyan). To see the data more clearly you can drag the nodes on the right around. Additionally, you can hover over them to see their industry and how many of those position titles are listed. We can see from the data that the majority of job postings are in the business sector currently, which explains why the technology and healthcare industries can be so competitive as there are less available jobs. The interactivity of the Sankey Diagram adds depth to the visualization, allowing users to engage with the data dynamically. By dragging nodes and hovering over them, users can gain insights into the distribution of job postings across different industries. This insight into the prevalence of business sector positions sheds light on the nature of the technology and healthcare fields, where opportunities may be comparatively scarce.</p>

    <h2>Heatmap of Top Skill Names by Experience Level</h2>
    <p>The heatmap visualizes the top 10 most sought-after skills, ranked by the number of job postings, with the X-axis representing skill names and the Y-axis representing the experience levels. The intensity of red shading indicates the frequency of job postings on LinkedIn. The graph reveals that entry-level and mid-senior roles dominate the job market across skill categories. Particularly, Information Technology and engineering stand out as high-demand sectors for mid-senior level positions. However, the scarcity of internship opportunities amidst the job postings presents a concerning trend for college students. This pattern underscores a systemic issue where companies prioritize hiring individuals with existing skills, neglecting investment in internship programs. This dearth of internships poses a significant challenge for college students aiming to gain practical experience and advance their careers.</p>

    <h2>Summary and additional work</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how the job market has been changing and have a professional insight of what skill levels are the most looked for throughout the job market and Linkedin which has been a crucial tool for job searching amongst a wide range of ages. 


    <p>Even Though we have been able to demonstrate what are the most important skill levels that corporations or businesses are looking for and what areas have the widest variety of job openings, we can say that there might be some room for improvement. Due to the fact that we did not have any precise time and day when the job postings were released in Linkedin we didn't have the chance of analyzing what job postings open up at what time of the year or what cycle which would have been very insightful to analyze.</p>
        

    <p>It is important to state that the data that we have been using is from 2023 and this might not be reliable in now-a-days job market nowadays since it has been fluctuating so much during this time that it might not be reliable. We might need to update the data that we use more often to get the most up to date information and analyze the most recent data information. </p>
