    <h2>Introduction to the data</h2>

        </p>

    <h2>The most common words or phrases used in job titles</h2>
    <p>The word cloud visualization is generated by extracting job titles from a DataFrame and representing them in a graphical format. The size of each word in the cloud corresponds to its frequency or significance relative to other words in the dataset. Analysis of the word cloud reveals that roles related to ownership, operation, and directorship constitute a substantial portion of the job market, underscoring the importance of leadership skill development. Additionally, sales, programming, and engineering skills emerge as commonly sought-after attributes. It's important to note that the choice of colors in the visualization is purely for aesthetic appeal and does not convey any specific meaning related to the textual content.</p>

    <h2>Heatmap of Top Skill Names by Experience Level</h2>
    <p>The heatmap visualizes the top 10 most sought-after skills, ranked by the number of job postings, with the X-axis representing skill names and the Y-axis representing the experience levels. The intensity of red shading indicates the frequency of job postings on LinkedIn. The graph reveals that entry-level and mid-senior roles dominate the job market across skill categories. Particularly, Information Technology and engineering stand out as high-demand sectors for mid-senior level positions. However, the scarcity of internship opportunities amidst the job postings presents a concerning trend for college students. This pattern underscores a systemic issue where companies prioritize hiring individuals with existing skills, neglecting investment in internship programs. This dearth of internships poses a significant challenge for college students aiming to gain practical experience and advance their careers.</p>

    <h2>Summary and additional work</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how the job market has been changing and have a professional insight of what skill levels are the most looked for throughout the job market and Linkedin which has been a crucial tool for job searching amongst a wide range of ages. 


    <p>Even Though we have been able to demonstrate what are the most important skill levels that corporations or businesses are looking for and what areas have the widest variety of job openings, we can say that there might be some room for improvement. Due to the fact that we did not have any precise time and day when the job postings were released in Linkedin we didn't have the chance of analyzing what job postings open up at what time of the year or what cycle which would have been very insightful to analyze.</p>
        

    <p>It is important to state that the data that we have been using is from 2023 and this might not be reliable in now-a-days job market nowadays since it has been fluctuating so much during this time that it might not be reliable. We might need to update the data that we use more often to get the most up to date information and analyze the most recent data information. </p>
